# github-manager

The goal is to create an application, where you can manage your local git repositories. You can:
1. Create a repo on github, and then simply just hit a button to take your project on to github.
2. Pushing changes will be as simple as clicks of buttons
3. Once the above is complete, then we move on to:
   1. Netlify integration: Create a similar "Deploy to Netlify" button to easily deploy to netlify
   2. If your project has a backend, create a "Deploy to Heroku" button to easily deploy to Heroku
   3. Both the above functionalities would abstract away the configuration burden
